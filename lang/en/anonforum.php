There are several anonymous forum types to choose from, such as a standard anonymous forum where anyone can start a new discussion at any time; a anonymous forum where each student can post exactly one discussion; or a question and answer anonymous forum where students must first post before being able to view other students\' posts. A teacher can allow files to be attached to anonymous forum posts. Attached images are displayed in the anonymous forum post.

Participants can subscribe to a anonymous forum to receive notifications of new anonymous forum posts. A teacher can set the subscription mode to optional, forced or auto, or prevent subscription completely. If required, students can be blocked from posting more than a given number of posts in a given time period; this can prevent individuals from dominating discussions.

Anonymous forum posts can be rated by teachers or students (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.

Anonymous forums have many uses, such as

* A social space for students to get to know each other
* For course announcements (using a news anonymous forum with forced subscription)
* For discussing course content or reading materials
* For continuing online an issue raised previously in a face-to-face session
* For teacher-only discussions (using a hidden anonymous forum)
* A help centre where tutors and students can give advice
* A one-on-one support area for private student-teacher communications (using a anonymous forum with separate groups and with one student per group)
* For extension activities, for example ‘brain teasers’ for students to ponder and suggest solutions to';
